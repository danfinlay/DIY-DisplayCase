#DIY.org Showcaser!

A web app for showcasing your DIY.org skills!

Displays a hex-grid of all the skill badges on the site, and then highlights yours.

Just `npm install` and then `node index.js` to run the server on your port 8005.

You can include a different port if you'd like, just enter `node index.js DESIRED_PORT`.

To view your trophy-case, go to `http://localhost:8005/#yourDiyUsername`, replacing "yourDiyUsername" with... oh, you get it.
